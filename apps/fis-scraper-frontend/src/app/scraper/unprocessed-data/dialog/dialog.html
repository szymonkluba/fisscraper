    This mode should be the most resistant to the errors (describing the columns
    is the most error prone). The downside is that data in CSV is not described.
    Generally it's kind of WYSIWYG mode. Data is placed in CSV in order in which
    it's displayed on FIS website. Please note that it means ie. that there will
    be no FIS code in CSV for detailed results as it's not displayed anywhere in
    detailed results table at fis-ski.com.
